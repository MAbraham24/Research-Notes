As my project further develops I’ve run into identifying the gap that is in my project, the gap being my knowledge on how I can possibly develop my project. The idea for my project is not something that I can easily just type into Google and get results, so it’s a matter of breaking it apart and understanding what exactly I need to know to go further in my development. In breaking my project apart, I discovered what exactly I need to do in my project, and that is to use the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a method to essentially try to make a computer understand natural language, like humans do. Knowing this information will fill my gap, as from what I can surmise, using Natural Language Processing will allow me to develop my idea without having to start completely from scratch. I was able to locate a book that is an introduction to NLP, and will talk about how Natural Language Processing is developed using Python. While I read the book I plan to employ the methods I find in my own project. By the time I finish the book, I should have a great idea of the next steps of my project and will be able to work from there.
