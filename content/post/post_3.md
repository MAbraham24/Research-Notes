title: Confirming Importance
---

When it comes to my project, my overall focus will be on technical writing. My possible project idea is one that I am currently working developing, but my overarching focus is in fact technical writing. My reason for focusing on technical writing is because it is something that is important, yet not talked about, and so I want to create something that will credit technical writing in some way. For my research I decided to firstly justify the need and benefits of technical writing. According to “A technical writing for computer science majors” an article by Lisa C. Kaczmarczyk “Currently there  is  little  concrete  evidence  of  progress  towards  increasing  CS  students’  writing  ability,  primarily  because  it  has  not  been  widely  studied”. This article reports the study of a computer science class that is focused on technical writing and their improvements. They did things such as having weekly meetings where they would go over scholarly articles and journal entries and engage with one another. By the end of the study there were more variables to report, but the biggest finding was that there was an increased confidence and ability to talk about high level ideas. There was also an increase in the quality of writing and personal knowledge of the students' writings, as they went in thinking they knew about grammar conventions, but ended up changing and improving their ability to write.
